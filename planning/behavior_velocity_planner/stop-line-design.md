### Stop Line

#### Role

This module plans velocity so that the vehicle can stop right before stop lines and restart driving after stopped.

#### Module Parameters

| Parameter         | Type   | Description                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stop_margin`     | double | a margin that the vehicle tries to stop before stop_line                                       |
| `stop_check_dist` | double | when the vehicle is within `stop_check_dist` from stop_line and stopped, move to STOPPED state |

  if (vehicle started to move?) then (yes)
    :change state to START;

  if ([optional] far from stop line?) then (yes)

This algorithm is based on `segment`.
`segment` consists of two node points. It's useful for removing boundary conditions because if `segment(i)` exists we can assume `node(i)` and `node(i+1)` exist.

First, this algorithm finds a collision between reference path and stop line.
Then, we can get `collision segment` and `collision point`.

![find_collision_segment](./docs/stop_line/find_collision_segment.drawio.svg)

Next, based on `collision point`, it finds `offset segment` by iterating backward points up to a specific offset length.
The offset length is `stop_margin`(parameter) + `base_link to front`(to adjust head pose to stop line).
Then, we can get `offset segment` and `offset from segment start`.

![find_offset_segment](./docs/stop_line/find_offset_segment.drawio.svg)

After that, we can calculate a offset point from `offset segment` and `offset`. This will be `stop_pose`.
